# Hexz in C++

Because ... why not have it in three different languages?!

## Install dependencies

On macos:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install protobuf
```

## Build the binary

All commands assume you are in the `cpp` subdirectory.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build . --clean-first
```
